# üîÆ Future Work: EMG-Based Control Enhancements

As part of the next phase of the Exoskeleton Arm project, advanced EMG signal processing and classification techniques are proposed for integration. These modules extend the current button-based interface into intelligent, muscle-driven actuation control.

## ‚úÖ 1. Real-Time EMG Signal Processing
Adapted from `signal-processing.ipynb`

- **Description:** Clean and process live EMG signals using bandpass filtering, rectification, and envelope detection.
- **Integration:** Replaces manual button input. Triggers actuator when smoothed EMG signal crosses a predefined threshold.
- **Status:** Prototype available in `firmware/signal_processing/emg_filter_logic.py`.

## ‚úÖ 2. EMG Monitoring Dashboard
Adapted from `emg-signal-complete-model.ipynb`

- **Description:** Visualizes live EMG signal with overlays on activation thresholds and filtered outputs.
- **Integration:** Use as a debugging tool or patient biofeedback system during rehab.
- **Proposed Tools:** Python + matplotlib or PyQt for live GUI.

## ‚úÖ 3. CNN-Based EMG Classification
Adapted from `emg-classification-with-cnn.ipynb`

- **Description:** Uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify EMG patterns corresponding to different arm movements (e.g., rest, lift, grasp).
- **Integration:** Enable multiple motion modes triggered by EMG gestures instead of only "lift/lower".
- **Pipeline:** 
  - Train CNN using labeled EMG samples.
  - Deploy lightweight inference model on Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
  - Replace `exoskeleton_control.ino` input logic with classifier output.
